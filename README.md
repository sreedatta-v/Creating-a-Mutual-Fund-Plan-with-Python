This repository created for a mutual fund plan for selecting the stocks where an investor can benefit in the long term

## Problem Description
Mutual funds are investment plans that pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, managed by professional fund managers. A mutual fund plan is created by selecting the stocks where an investor can benefit in the long term. So, if you want to learn how a mutual fund plan is created by analyzing the market performance over time, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of creating a mutual fund plan with Python.

### Creating a Mutual Fund
A mutual fund plan is created by selecting the stocks where an investor can benefit in the long term. Here’s the process we can follow to create a mutual fund plan:  

[Step 1:](https://github.com/sreedatta-v/Creating-a-Mutual-Fund-Plan-with-Python/blob/main/README.md)   
Gather historical stock data, such as closing prices and growth trends over time.  

[Step 2:](https://github.com/sreedatta-v/Creating-a-Mutual-Fund-Plan-with-Python/blob/main/README.md)  
Calculate key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and volatility (risk) to understand how each stock has performed historically.  

[Step 3:](https://github.com/sreedatta-v/Creating-a-Mutual-Fund-Plan-with-Python/blob/main/README.md)  
Choose stocks that have a high ROI and low volatility to ensure a balance between risk and reward.  

[Step 4:](https://github.com/sreedatta-v/Creating-a-Mutual-Fund-Plan-with-Python/blob/main/README.md)  
Calculate the future value of monthly investments based on the expected ROI of the selected stocks.   

## Data Sources 

Download the dataset from [here.](https://statso.io/mutual-funds-bucket-case-study/)

### Distribution of Data: 
Date: The date on which the stock price is recorded.  

Closing Price: The adjusted closing price for each stock on that particular date.  

Companies: A total of 50 top Indian companies are represented, covering a range of sectors like banking (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank), technology (TCS, Infosys), consumer goods (Hindustan Unilever, ITC), automotive (Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto), and others.  

## Problem Statement: 
The goal is to develop a Mutual Funds Investment Bucket that is optimized for long-term investments by balancing risk and returns. This involves selecting companies that provide consistent growth and moderate returns while minimizing exposure to volatility. Specifically, the objectives are:  

<b>Stock Selection:</b> Identify stocks with high <b>ROI and low volatility</b>, which will form the core of the mutual funds portfolio.  

<b>Performance Evaluation:</b> Use metrics such as <b>volatility (standard deviation) and expected ROI</b> to assess which stocks are optimal for inclusion in the portfolio.  

<b>Investment Strategy:</b> Simulate the expected future value of investments based on monthly contributions over different time horizons (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years).  

<b>Risk-Reward Balance:</b> Develop a strategy that ensures a balance between <b>risk and reward,</b> targeting long-term investors who seek stable, compounded growth over several years.
